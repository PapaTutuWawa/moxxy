- (Hopefully) fix OMEMO between two Moxxy clients.
- Allow correcting messages older than the last one. Whether all clients will accept such a correction is unclear.
- Add (incomplete) translations for Dutch, French, Galician, Japanese, Polish, and Russian.
- Fix having to long-press a message bubble on its corner to active the selection menu.
- If enabled, read markers are automatically sent.
- Highlight legacy quotes in text messages.
- Fix Moxxy's app icon having a badge because of the foreground service.
- Make the notifications much prettier and compliant with Android 13.
- Prevent Moxxy from crashing on startup on a fresh device.
- Video thumbnails are now generated, if possible, after a video has been downloaded.
- The Moxxy APKs will now be signed by a different key stored on my YubiKey. You will have to uninstall and reinstall Moxxy. This will remove all your data.
- Moxxy now uses Android's direct share shortcuts.
- Moxxy now uses Android 13's new photo picker, whenever possible. This should allow Moxxy to require fewer permissions to work.
