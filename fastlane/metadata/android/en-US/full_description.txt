Moxxy is an experimental XMPP client that aims to be modern and easy to use.

Moxxy is currently alpha software. This means that there will be bugs and issues along
the way. Please do not use Moxxy for anything important at this moment.

Currently supported features include:
<ul>
  <li>Sending and receiving files and images</li>
  <li>Setting your profile picture</li>
  <li>Typing indicators and message markers</li>
  <li>Chat backgrounds</li>
  <li>Runs in the background without Push Notifications</li>
</ul>

For the best experience, I recommend a server that:
<ul>
  <li>Supports direct TLS/StartTLS on the same domain as in the Jid</li>
  <li>Supports SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256</li>
  <li>Supports HTTP File Upload</li>
  <li>Supports Stream Management</li>
  <li>Supports Client State Indication</li>
</ul>
